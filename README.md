## Installation

To install Shrimpcast, follow these steps:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need a valid domain to run this script, with properly configured DNS records.

> [!NOTE]
> Recommended OS: Ubuntu x64 22.04 LTS

1. On a fresh VPS, run:

   ```bash
   wget -O install.sh https://github.com/shrimpcast/shrimpcast/releases/latest/download/install.sh
   chmod +x install.sh
   ./install.sh -d [YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME]
   ```

   Make sure to replace `[YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME]` with your domain name.
   
   Your instance will automatically reboot after the installation completes.


3. (Optional) If you're using Cloudflare as a reverse proxy, run:

   ```bash
   wget -O cloudflare_setup.sh https://github.com/shrimpcast/shrimpcast/releases/latest/download/cloudflare_setup.sh
   chmod +x cloudflare_setup.sh
   ./cloudflare_setup.sh
   ```

   This script will restrict traffic outside Cloudflare and apply a few required configuration tweaks.

And that's it! Shrimpcast should now be up and running. You can now try to access your domain URL. Make sure to save the admin session that was generated during the installation, which you can find at `/root/shrimpcast/setup/GeneratedAdminToken.txt`, or at the end of step 1.

## Troubleshooting

- .NET SDK installed but not found: <br>
  run `sudo snap remove dotnet-sdk && sudo apt remove -y 'dotnet*' 'aspnetcore*' 'netstandard*' && sudo rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft-prod.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft-prod.list.save && sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y dotnet8`
  then add the `--skipdotnet` flag to the install script and re-run it: `./install.sh [...] --skipdotnet`
- Certbot fails: <br>
  Ensure that port 80 on your VPS is publicly accessible and that your domainâ€™s DNS is correctly configured. Then run:
  `sudo apt-get remove --purge nginx nginx-common`  <br>
  `sudo rm -rf /etc/nginx`  <br>
  `sudo apt-get autoremove --purge`  <br>
  then re-run the install script.

## Throughput estimation
This guide will help you accurately measure your server's actual upload speed using parallel connections, simulating real-world network usage.

### 1. Set up real-time monitoring

Open your first SSH session and run:

```bash
apt update && apt install nload
nload
```

### 2. Run the speed test

Open a second SSH session and run:

- Option 1 ([LibreSpeed CLI tool](https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest-cli))
```bash
# Download and extract librespeed-cli
wget https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest-cli/releases/download/v1.0.11/librespeed-cli_1.0.11_linux_386.tar.gz
tar -xzf librespeed-cli_1.0.11_linux_386.tar.gz

# Launch multiple parallel upload tests
for i in {1..8}; do 
  ./librespeed-cli --no-download --no-icmp --duration 30 &
done
wait
```

- Option 2 (Speedtest CLI)
```bash
# Download and install speedtest-cli
apt update && apt install speedtest-cli

# Launch multiple parallel upload tests
for i in {1..8}; do 
  speedtest-cli --no-download --secure &
done
wait
```

This will:
- Provide a realistic measurement of your server's maximum upload capacity

## Example output

When running properly, you'll see real-time throughput statistics in your first terminal window while the tests are executing in your second window.

![Upload speed test results example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f035573-3408-4cfb-857a-03637f6bf2e6)


## Why this works

By running multiple parallel upload tests, you simulate real-world conditions where multiple connections share your server's bandwidth, giving you a more accurate picture of your server's true upload capabilities than a single-threaded test.

## Media Server

You can access its panel by visiting {your_domain}/ui.

If you're using Cloudflare, for RTMP broadcast, you'll need to bypass the domain proxy (but don't worry, it's already configured to allow 1935!) and stream directly to the VPS IP (e.g., rtmp://{your_vps_ip}/{livestream}).

## Debug

First, clone the repository.
To debug the project, you will need:
- Visual Studio / VS code
- .NET 8 SDK & runtime
- PostgreSQL

Make sure that your PostgreSQL instance is properly configured.

## Usage

### Getting started

Once you have Shrimpcast up and running, you will need to authenticate as an admin. To do this, use the token saved at `/root/shrimpcast/setup/GeneratedAdminToken.txt`, and follow these instructions:

![image](https://github.com/shrimpcast/shrimpcast/assets/167498236/2c62fc16-0f58-4147-b90b-3daa610642a1)

1. Press the top-left button.
2. Paste the token and submit.

And that's it! You're now authenticated as an admin.

### Configuration

Once you're authenticated as an admin, you will have the following options:
